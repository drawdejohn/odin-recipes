        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Shrimp is the major component of the Filipino sour soup known as sinigang na hipon. Other veggies in this meal include daikon radish, snake beans, okra, and eggplant. The greatest time to serve this dish is in a chilly climate. The best way to enjoy it is hot with some white rice.
